# Chromatic Security Audit - October 31, 2025

## Task #154: Security Fixes for Chromatic Game

### Audit Summary

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Auditor**: Claude Code (Rails Expert)
**Tool**: Brakeman 7.1.0
**Result**: All critical security issues resolved

---

## Security Scan Results

### Brakeman Scan
- **Security Warnings**: 0
- **Scan Duration**: 0.348 seconds
- **Files Analyzed**: 3 controllers, 3 models, 7 templates

---

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. CSRF Protection ✓ FIXED

**Issue**: CSRF protection was disabled for all game actions
```ruby
# BEFORE (INSECURE)
skip_forgery_protection only: [:create, :play_card, :end_turn, :continue_round]
```

**Fix**: Re-enabled CSRF protection, added validation
```ruby
# AFTER (SECURE)
before_action :set_game, only: [:show, :play_card, :end_turn, :continue_round]
before_action :validate_game_state, only: [:play_card, :end_turn, :continue_round]
```

**Impact**:
- All POST requests now require valid CSRF token
- form_with and button_to automatically include tokens
- Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks

**Testing**:
- ✓ POST without token returns 422 Unprocessable Content
- ✓ POST with valid token succeeds

---

### 2. Game State Tampering Protection ✓ FIXED

**Issue**: Game state stored in JSON could be tampered with

**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation method `valid_game_state?`

**Validates**:
- Game state is a Hash
- Required keys exist (deck, player_hand, ai_hand, turn)
- Deck and hands are arrays
- All cards have proper structure (color, number)
- Card colors match COLORS constant
- Card numbers within valid range (1-20)
- Scores are non-negative
- Round numbers are valid (1 to total_rounds)
- Status is one of: active, round_ending, finished

**Implementation**:
```ruby
def valid_game_state?
  # Validates game state integrity
  # Returns false if any validation fails
  # See: app/models/concerns/game_utilities.rb
end
```

**Usage**:
```ruby
before_action :validate_game_state, only: [:play_card, :end_turn, :continue_round]
```

**Impact**:
- Prevents players from modifying deck/hand/scores
- Prevents invalid game states from being processed
- Redirects to root with error on tampering detection

---

### 3. Input Validation ✓ FIXED

**Issue**: No validation of card_index and color parameters

**Fix**: Added validation methods in controller

**Validates**:
- `card_index` is not blank
- `card_index` is within player hand bounds (0 to hand.length - 1)
- `color` is one of the 5 valid colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple)

**Implementation**:
```ruby
def valid_card_index?(index)
  return false if index.blank?
  index_int = index.to_i
  index_int >= 0 && index_int < @game.player_hand.length
end

def valid_color?(color)
  Game::COLORS.include?(color)
end
```

**Impact**:
- Prevents index out of bounds errors
- Prevents invalid color selections
- Returns user-friendly error message

---

### 4. XSS Prevention ✓ VERIFIED SECURE

**Issue**: Potential XSS in flash messages

**Status**: Already secure (Rails default behavior)

**Protection**:
- Rails automatically escapes HTML with `<%= %>`
- Flash messages properly escaped
- All user input sanitized by default

**Verification**:
```erb
<%= notice %>  <!-- Automatically escaped -->
<%= alert %>   <!-- Automatically escaped -->
```

**Impact**: No XSS vulnerabilities found

---

### 5. Session Security ✓ FIXED

**Issue**: No session security configuration

**Fix**: Added secure session store configuration

**Configuration**:
```ruby
Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store,
  key: '_chromatic_session',
  secure: Rails.env.production?,  # HTTPS only in production
  httponly: true,                  # Prevent JavaScript access
  same_site: :lax,                 # CSRF protection
  expire_after: 24.hours           # Session timeout
```

**Impact**:
- Cookies not accessible via JavaScript (XSS mitigation)
- Cookies only sent over HTTPS in production
- CSRF protection via SameSite
- Automatic session expiration

**Production Verification**:
```
set-cookie: _chromatic_session=...; path=/; expires=...; secure; httponly; samesite=lax
```

---

## Additional Security Headers

### Verified Present on Production

1. **X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN**
   - Prevents clickjacking attacks
   - Page cannot be embedded in iframe on different domain

2. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
   - Prevents MIME type sniffing
   - Forces browser to respect declared content type

3. **X-XSS-Protection: 0**
   - Modern browsers use CSP instead
   - Appropriate for Rails 8 applications

---

## Testing & Verification

### Local Testing
✓ Rails server started on port 3001
✓ CSRF protection working (422 without token)
✓ Session cookies have security flags
✓ Game state validation working
✓ Input validation working

### Production Testing

✓ CSRF protection verified (422 without token)
✓ Session cookies secure: `secure; httponly; samesite=lax`
✓ Security headers present
✓ Game functionality working
